description: Generate self-documentation for a Pet.Jira feature — scaffolds wwwroot/documents/features/{id}/ with index.md (full description), preview.md (short blurb for preview cards), metadata.json and an images/ folder. Use when the user wants to document a feature, add a "what's new" entry, or create a feature description for the site's Features section / worklog random-feature widget.

# Feature documentation generator

This skill creates a self-documenting feature folder that the app reads to render
the **Features** section (`/features`) and the **random-feature** widget shown in the
worklog window's empty state.

## When to use

Use this when the user asks to "document a feature", "add a what's-new entry",
"describe feature X for the site", or after shipping a feature that should appear in
the Features section.

## Where files go

All feature docs live under:

```
src/Pet.Jira.Web/wwwroot/documents/features/{feature-id}/
├── index.md          full description (rendered in the detail dialog)
├── preview.md        short blurb (rendered on cards and the worklog widget)
├── metadata.json     structured metadata (title, author, date, tags…)
└── images/           screenshots referenced by the markdown
```

- `{feature-id}` is **kebab-case**, unique, stable (it is the URL/key). Example: `yandex-calendar-integration`.
- The folder is served statically, so images are referenced by absolute URL:
  `/documents/features/{feature-id}/images/{file}.png`. **Never** use a relative path.

## Steps

1. **Gather inputs.** Determine, asking the user only for what you cannot infer:
   - `id` (kebab-case slug), `title` (human-readable, the app's UI language is Russian),
     `author` (default: current git user / repo owner), `date` (today, `YYYY-MM-DD`),
     `tags` (optional), short summary, and the full description.
   - If documenting an existing feature, read the relevant code/components first so the
     description is accurate.
2. **Create the folder** `src/Pet.Jira.Web/wwwroot/documents/features/{id}/` and an empty
   `images/` subfolder (add a `.gitkeep` if there are no images yet so the folder is tracked).
3. **Write `metadata.json`** from `templates/metadata.json` — fill every field.
4. **Write `preview.md`** from `templates/preview.md` following the rules below.
5. **Write `index.md`** from `templates/index.md`.
6. **Images.** If the user provides screenshots, place them in `images/` and reference them
   in `index.md`. Otherwise leave `images/` empty (with `.gitkeep`) and omit image tags.
7. **Confirm** the created paths back to the user. Do **not** edit the app's C# / Razor code —
   this skill only produces content files; the app already discovers them automatically.

## metadata.json schema

```json
{
  "id": "yandex-calendar-integration",
  "title": "Интеграция с Яндекс.Календарём",
  "author": "tolmachev-pravo",
  "date": "2026-06-30",
  "tags": ["extensions", "calendar"],
  "isHighlighted": false
}
```

- `id` MUST equal the folder name.
- `date` is ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`; the app sorts features by this descending (newest first)
  and shows a "new" badge for recent ones.
- `isHighlighted` (optional, default `false`) pins the feature to the top of the section.
- `tags` is optional.

## preview.md rules

The preview is rendered on small cards and inside the worklog widget — keep it tight:

- **No H1/H2 headings.** One short paragraph, ideally **≤ 280 characters**.
- Lead with the user benefit, not implementation detail.
- At most **one** inline image, and only if it genuinely helps at thumbnail size.
- No links that navigate away — the card itself links to the detail view.

## index.md rules

- **Do not repeat the feature title as an H1** — the Features section and the detail dialog
  already render the title from `metadata.json`. Start with a short intro paragraph.
- Use `##` for subsections (e.g. "Что это даёт", "Как пользоваться").
- Explain what it does, why it's useful, and how to use it. Use lists and images.
- **Call out interesting or non-obvious behaviour.** If a feature has a nuance, a hidden
  trick, a prerequisite or a gotcha (e.g. "a task key in the event title is matched
  automatically"), don't let it go unmentioned — add it in the relevant section as a
  callout note so users actually benefit from it.
- Write callouts as blockquotes, optionally led by an emoji, e.g.
  `> 💡 <совет>` or `> ⚠️ <важное ограничение>`. **Footnote syntax (`[^id]`) is not
  supported** by the renderer and will be dropped — use blockquotes instead.
- Reference images by absolute URL (see above). Keep image widths reasonable.

## Templates

See the `templates/` folder for ready-to-copy skeletons.
